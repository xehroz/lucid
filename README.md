# 💠 Project Lucid: The Isometric Urdu Orthography

**Project Lucid** is a structural modernization of the Urdu writing system. It introduces an atomic, monospaced, and non-joining neography designed specifically for the digital age.

By bypassing the computational "shaping" requirements of traditional Nastaliq, Lucid allows for phonetic Urdu typing on any standard QWERTY keyboard with zero additional software installation, utilizing a rigorous **25mm x 25mm isometric grid**.

## 👁️ The Vision

Traditional Urdu (Nastaliq) is a masterpiece of calligraphy but a challenge for digital engineering. **Lucid** offers a "Third Way"—preserving the phonetic soul and Right-to-Left (RTL) flow of Urdu while adopting the ergonomic efficiency of monospaced Latin scripts.

* **One Sound, One Glyph:** No initial, medial, or final forms.
* **Monospaced Geometry:** Every character is a perfect square.
* **Searchable Data:** Internally stored as standard phonetic Latin; externally displayed as Lucid glyphs.
* **Zero-Setup:** Works in any RTL-aware environment (Word, Browsers, IDEs) via OpenType substitution.

## 🛠️ Technical Specifications

### 1. The 25mm Standard

Every glyph in this repository is designed within a **25mm x 25mm master square**.

* **Units Per Em (UPM):** 1000
* **Advance Width:** 1000 (Strict Monospace)
* **Source Assets:** 37 high-fidelity vector glyphs.

### 2. The Phonetic Engine

Project Lucid utilizes the **OpenType `calt` (Contextual Alternates)** feature to map standard QWERTY input to the 37-glyph inventory.

| Input | Glyph PUA | Phoneme | Logic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `a` | `U+E014` | ا | Short Vowel |
| `b` | `U+E000` | ب | Labial Plosive |
| `T` | `U+E003` | ٹ | Retroflex |
| `~` | `U+E01C` | ں | Nasalization |

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Install** the `LucidUrdu.otf` font.
2. **Open** any text editor (MS Word, VS Code, Browser).
3. **Select** the "Lucid Urdu" font.
4. **Enable** Right-to-Left (RTL) paragraph direction.
5. **Type** phonetically (e.g., typing `p a k i s t a n` renders the Lucid isometric symbols).
